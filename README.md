# Distributed Coordination over Undirected graphs using Row-stochastic weights

This project is an ongoing part of my Master Thesis at Aalto University.  The Master thesis is being supervised by [Themistoklis Charalambous](https://themistoklis.org/), Associate Professor, Aalto University.

Implementation of the following research paper.
