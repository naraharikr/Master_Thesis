# Distributed Coordination over Directed graphs using Row-stochastic weights

This project is an ongoing part of my Master Thesis at Aalto University.  The Master thesis is being supervised by [Themistoklis Charalambous](https://themistoklis.org/), Associate Professor, Aalto University.  Also, he heads [Distributed and Networked Control Systems](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-automation/distributed-and-networked-control-systems) research group, which focuses on blending control theory, communication theory and information theory

The master thesis focuses primalrily to reproduce the distributed optimisation algorithms proposed in the following research paper.
